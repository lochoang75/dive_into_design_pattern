# Structural Design Patterns
Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structure flexible and efficient.
It include:
- Adapter: Allow objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate
- Bridge: Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierachies-abstraction and implementation-which can be developed independently of each other.
- Composite: Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if the were individual objects.
- Decorator: Let you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these object inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
- Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
- Flyweight: Lets you fit more objects into available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objets instead of keeping all of the data in each object.
- Proxy: Lets you provide a substitute of placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
